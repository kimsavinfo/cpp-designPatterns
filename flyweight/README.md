# Flyweight

Component that acts as a “smart reference” to something. 
Usually, flyweights are used in situations where there is a very large number of very similar objects, and the developer wants  to minimize the amount of memory that is dedicated to storing all these values.

## With CMAKE / Without IDE
````
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
./bin/${PROJECT_NAME}
```
